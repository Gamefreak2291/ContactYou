# Hello!
Hi there thecodingman, please don't assume this spam.

My name is Ryan Dingman, and I'm starting to build a name for myself in the development world and given my name, I'm looking to try and go by "TheCoDingman" as a pun of my name.  You already have this username on gitHub but it appears that you have no activity on your account. Would there be anyway we could discuss transferring ownership of your account over to me to use?

Please reach out to me via e-mail: gamefreak2291@hotmail.com

I look forward to hearing from you.
